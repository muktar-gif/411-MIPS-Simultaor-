# 411-MIPS-Simulator
The program is a simulation of a five-stage pipline for MIPS Assembly using a high-level programming lanuage. The program is given a file with MIPS Assembly instruction and converts the instructions into binary formant. It then runs the instructions into a five-stage pipline mimicking operations similar to MIPS processor architecture. The program will output files that logs intructions ran along with its "clock cycle" at each stage, memory space represented in binary, and register values. Each version adds additional support for different architectural components.
# MIP_Simulator_Version1
